    "Through my previous experiences, I have developed and enhanced my software engineering and problem-solving skills. These skills have allowed me to approach problem-solving in various ways, which is essential in the field of software engineering. I strongly believe that having a versatile perspective is an advantage when tackling different types of problems, which is why I often choose to explore topics on my own.",
    "Currently, I am interested in exploring data visualization to create more value around data. From my experience, I believe that visualization can be a powerful tool in understanding complex data sets and making them more accessible to a broader audience. I am excited about creating projects that can present data in an easy-to-understand format and can be shared with others.",
    "Iâ€™m also interested in live collaboration and multiplayer software, as well as the mathematics behind CRDT-based real-time collaboration algorithms. In large organizations, effective communication and collaboration are crucial, and live collaboration software can improve team efficiency regardless of location. I aim to create seamless collaboration software to help people achieve their objectives. With my experience in handling large-scale systems and optimizing them for high traffic, I have gained insight into the mathematics behind CRDT-based real-time collaboration algorithms. I hope to further my understanding of the math and use my skills to create better real-time collaboration systems.",
