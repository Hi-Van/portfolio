            Hey, I'm Van.
            I'm currently a sophomore at the <a className="reference" href="https://uconn.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Connecticut. </a>
            I'm the founder of the UConn Stamford Engineer Majors, a group of collaborative students at the UConn Stamford campus.
            I've recently been a part of an initiative group called <a className="reference" href="https://summerofshipping.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Summer of Shipping </a> as a core team member and frontend developer.
            When I'm not drowning in my coursework, I like to work out and watch YouTube tutorials I'll never do.
            You can also find me scrolling through <a className="reference" href="https://twitter.com/Hi_Im_Van" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>,
            making commits on <a className="reference" href="https://github.com/Hi-Van" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>,
            or networking on <a className="reference" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/van-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>.
          </p>
